API week project

## Features

1) Our app queries at least two APIs using the XMLHttpRequest method:
a) Open Movie DB API and Today in History API

2) Users can view the dynamic content pulled from the OMDB using the search button at the bottom of the app and then view details of each movie by clicking on a movie poster. In the details page of each movie a fun fact is displayed at the bottom of the page based on the movie released date.

3)We aimed for a responsive, mobile-first design with accessible features.
